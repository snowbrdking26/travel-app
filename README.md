# Travel-Tripn App

<br>

Travel-Tripn app is where users can share itineraries from vacations and also see hotels and flights associated with those destinations.

<br>

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Angular
- Express
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Node.js
- CSS/Bootstrap/W3Schools
- HTML
- Atom for text-editing

<br>

## Approach

We created a travel blog where users can share itineraries from vacations and also see hotels and flights associated with those destinations.

<br>

## Technical Challenges

- Collaborating with Github, working on different branches, and merging.
- Styling with CSS/Bootstrap is really fun but I ran into alignment and column issues.
- Finding a travel API we could use. Travelocity didn't work out due to a high demand.
- Populating each new post in the show route into the styled cards.

<br>

## Future Improvements

- Build out the additional routes for restaurants, galleries, hotels, and Itineraries.
